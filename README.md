## Introduction
This is a web app I developed myself that allows users to generate custom vacation itineraries/plans by choosing their destination, dates, preferences, and number of people. The app uses an OpenAI model to generate a detailed plan for each day of the requested vacation. I have also added a visible map of the generated vacation routes for each day with the help of the MapBoxGL Library. The app is deployed with Vercel on this link - https://vacation-planner-teal.vercel.app/


* Used Technologies
    * VueJS -> frontend framework
    * NodeJS -> backend framework
    * OpenAI API -> AI text generation
    * MapBoxGL -> generation of custom maps
    * TailwindCSS + ShadCN -> styling


## Documentation
I explained my entire process of creating this web app from start to finish in a couple of PDF documents which you can find in the /documentation folder of this repo.
